# Overview

## Description

<!-- {Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->

I plan to write at least one piece of software to demonstrate my grasp of the C++ language. That project is a digital calculator.

## Purpose

<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->

My purpose is writing this software is to create a GUI of the most basic function that a computer is capable of, controlled by a user. Calculators are used by everyone in daily life, so I want to show that I can make my own as my first beginner project.

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.} -->

# Development Environment

<!-- {Describe the tools that you used to develop the software} -->

I used Visual Studio Community 2019 in order to develop this calculator.

<!-- {Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.} -->

C++ was my language of choice because it is so powerful and fast.
